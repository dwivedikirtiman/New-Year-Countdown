## 📝 Special Mention
This project was created on 13th March 2025. If you're running this project in a different year, the countdown may display incorrect results.

To ensure the countdown works correctly, follow these two simple updates:

**🔧 1. Update ```index.js```**

In the ```index.js``` file, locate the following line:

```const newYearTime = new Date("2026-01-01T00:00:00").getTime();```

If you’re using this project in **2026** for the **2027** countdown, update it as follows:

```const newYearTime = new Date("2027-01-01T00:00:00").getTime();```

**🖥️ 2. Update ```index.html```**

In the ```index.html``` file, find the following line:

```<div class="year">2026</div>```

Simply update the year to match your intended countdown target.

By making these two small changes, your countdown timer will work seamlessly every year.
